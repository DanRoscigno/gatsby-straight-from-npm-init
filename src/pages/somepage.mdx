Blah blah blah, and if you are not using Elastic Cloud blah blah

The logo and info regarding Elastic Cloud below is included from a standalone `.mdx` file, and inside the source of this page it is imported by:

```shell
import CloudCallout from '../includefiles/cloudCallout.mdx'
```

It is then rendered by

```shell
<CloudCallout/>
```

<CloudCallout/>
